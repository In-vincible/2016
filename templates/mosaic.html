		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">Have you heard about the sixth sense technology developed by Pranav Mistry and have you ever
thought of trying to implement a few of its basic features by yourself? If NO, then Google it silly. If
YES, then we present you Mosaic, a platform where you are going to implement basic <b>motion
tracking & gesture recognition</b> using image processing and machine learning techniques.<br>
<br><br>
    </p>
<h2>
Problem Statement:
</h2>

<p  style=" text-align: left">
 Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G0g9eRVxc9y6Shjhre0E4_FYS0s4OFai">here</a> to get the problem statement. <!--<br>
Round 1 requires the teams to work with Image Processing only.<br>
Design a real time Pinch and Zoom function for captured images for the Image Editor. The
participants are allowed to use coloured markers such as tapes or caps over two fingers and
implement pinch and zoom operation. Bonus marks will be awarded to teams who
successfully implement rotation of image too.<br>
    <b>ROUND 2:</b><br>
Round 2 requires the teams to implement basic <b>motion tracking & gesture recognition</b> using
Machine Learning.<br>
The teams now have to use motion gestures to implement more functionalities like panning,
skewing and manipulating the contrast/brightness of the image in real time. The teams will
have to include a mandatory gesture of “tick” which will save the image in the final frame
into local disk. Apart from that, the teams have the freedom to use any number of gestures
to implement more innovative functions.<br>
<b>No training dataset will be provided.</b> Participants have to create their own dataset for the
gestures they are trying to implement.<br>
The teams will be judged on the basis of the number of successful and useful functionalities
in addition to the robustness of the code.</p>

<h2>

Event Structure:
</h2>

<p  style=" text-align: left">
    There will be 2 rounds. Details are in problem statement.<br>
    There can be maximum 3 participants in one team.
<!--
    The event will be conducted in two rounds. Round one will be the qualifying round and round
two will be final round and an extension of round one.<br>
The participants will be judged based on the performance in both the rounds. <b>Goodies are to be
won after Round 1 also.</b><br>
The participants are required to share any innovative techniques that they have implemented in
their codes and there will be special marks awarded if the event coordinators are impressed.<br>
Sufficient time will be provided to the participants for calibration to the ambient lighting but the
participants are advised to make the code as robust as possible to avoid unnecessary wastage
of time.<br>
Running time of the codes of the participants will also be noted down as a mandatory criterion.<br>
A few other criterions that have not been revealed shall be released before the event starts as
an element of surprise.<br>
</p>
        -->
<h2>
Judging Criteria:
</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
    Inovation, minimal time run, efficiency of code.<br>
    Final decision will be of Judges.
    <!--
1. The participant must be a registered student of an educational institution.<br>
2. Team may consist of a maximum of 3 members.<br>
3. Participants from different educational institutions may form a team.<br>
4. All students must bring a valid identity card of their respective institutions.<br>
5. Every team must get ready in specified time failing which will lead to disqualification.<br>
6. The decision of the event coordinators is final and must be abided by all.<br>
7. Plagiarism of codes can lead to disqualification of any teams involved. Any help required can
be sought from the event coordinators.<br>
8. Any changes to the Problem Statement shall be highlighted on the website. Hence,
participants are advised to visit the website regularly.<br>
