		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">Analogue signals are those in which information is represented by a continuously variable physical quantity such as spatial position, voltage etc. The event encapsulates the use of transducers to convert physical phenomenon into equivalent electrical signals. 'Continuum' focuses on design of circuits that are useful to derive meaning out of these continuously varying quantities. The event incorporates both actual realization of circuits and simulation while the latter shall aid the participants in case the circuits are voluminous.

Problem Statement:
</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
For years, designers of industrial, medical, and other isolated systems had limited options when implementing safety isolation: the only reasonable choice was the opto-isolator.<br>
An opto-isolator is a component that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light.They prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal.<br>
Today, digital isolators offer advantages in performance, size, cost, power efficiency, and integration.So the task is to simulate digital isolator.

Event Structure:
</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
Each team can consist of at max 2 members.<br>
Event consists of 3 rounds:<br>
1.) Simulation pre-event<br>
2.) Simulation main event<br>
3.) Quiz<br>
There would be an on spot quiz related to the concepts covered in workshop including basic RLC circuit analysis.
