		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">Have you heard about the sixth sense technology developed by Pranav Mistry and have you ever thought of trying to implement a few of its basic features by yourself? If NO, then Google it silly. If YES, then we present you Mosaic, a platform where you are going to implement basic gesture recognition using image processing and machine learning techniques..

<h2>
Problem Statement:
</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
For years, designers of industrial, medical, and other isolated systems had limited options when implementing safety isolation: the only reasonable choice was the opto-isolator.<br>
An opto-isolator is a component that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light.They prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal.<br>
Today, digital isolators offer advantages in performance, size, cost, power efficiency, and integration.So the task is to simulate digital isolator.

Event Structure:
</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
Each team can consist of at max 2 members.<br>
Event consists of 3 rounds:<br>
1.) Simulation pre-event<br>
2.) Simulation main event<br>
3.) Quiz<br>
There would be an on spot quiz related to the concepts covered in workshop including basic RLC circuit analysis.
