		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">Does it strike your mind how do the extensive communication
networks work reliably? The event is designed to be accessible
to the new learners of digital communication, yet at the same
time pose a challenge to the experienced students. The challenge
is to implement a software model reflecting the functioning of a
part of a digital communication system in the real world. The
implementation should be such that the information reaches the
desired device without considerable loss. The event will test your
innovation potential along with the major focus on getting you familiar with the advances in
communication technology.

    <!--
    Implementation of 2 x 2 MIMO ( 2 Transmitters, 2 Receivers) with DSSS modulation.<br>
You will be given message signals (2) which are to be DSSS modulated.<br>
Channel characteristics (i.e. Channel transition matrix and Noise characteristics) will be provided. The resulting message is to be mapped such that you should be able to extract the independent messages out of it.
-->

<h2>
Event Structure:
</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
    A team can consist at most 3 students for first years and 2 students for rest.<br>There are two rounds in the event.<br>

    <!--
Teams are evaluated on the basis of compactness, efficiency and run time of the code.<br>
    Weightage of different sections are 40% MIMO mechanism + 30% DSSS implementation + 20% Viva/Quiz + 10% Code Run time and efficiency.

Judging Criteria:

</h2>
<p  style=" text-align: left">
    Teams are evaluated on the basis of compactness, efficiency and run time of the code.
    <!--
A team can consist at most 3 students for first years and 2 students for rest.<br><b>There are two rounds in the event.</b><br>
    First round has spot implementation with given parameters. Second round consists of Viva/Quiz.
    <br>Winners are ensured with exciting prizes and special goodies for teams which tops Quiz.
